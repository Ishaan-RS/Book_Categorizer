# Book_Categorizer
A book categorizer which predicts the genre of any book by reading its title and its author.

This NN model gets trained on custom generated book dataset and uses text vectorization to predict a book's genre.

It was inspired by the well-known Language Toxicity NN model.

Everything is done, just REMEMBER:- DO ADD THE PATH TO THE DATASET IN THE BEGINNING. Rest is done.
