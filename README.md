# Book Genre Categorizer using RNN-LSTM

This repository contains a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to predict the genre of any book based on its title and author. The model is trained on a custom-generated dataset and leverages text vectorization to convert book titles and authors into vectors that serve as input features for genre prediction.

## Features:
* RNN-LSTM Architecture: Designed to handle the sequential nature of text data for accurate genre prediction.
* Text Vectorization: Converts titles and authors into a vector dictionary, providing a robust foundation for the model's predictions.
* Custom Dataset: Trained on a dataset specifically generated for this project, ensuring relevance and performance.

## Setup:
* **Dataset Path**: Before running the model, make sure to specify the path to your dataset at the beginning of the code. This is crucial for the model to load and train on the data correctly.
* **Dependencies**: Ensure you have all necessary libraries installed, which can typically be done via requirements.txt (if provided).

## Inspiration:
This model was inspired by the well-known Language Toxicity Neural Network model, adapting similar principles to categorize books based on textual information.

## Usage:
* Clone the repository.
* Set the path to your dataset in the code.
* Train the model and evaluate its performance.
